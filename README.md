This is a basic boilerplate for creating a FiveM resource using Typescript. It includes webpack config files, linting (ESlint + prettier) and a directory structure to get you started. We recommend to use [fivem-js](https://github.com/d0p3t/fivem-js) alongside this boilerplate for faster development of client scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone repository into your `resources/[local]` folder.
2. `yarn install` the dependencies.
3. Start development.

### Development
Use `yarn run watch` to watch files during development.

### Production
Build your production ready code with `yarn run build`.

This will build the client and server script with the `--mode production` flag.

### Automatic Builds (Optional)
The `fxmanifest.lua` is setupped to automatically build upon first FXServer start. If you'd like to disable automatic builds you must remove the following from your `fxmanifest.lua`.

```lua
dependency 'yarn'
dependency 'webpack'

webpack_config 'webpack.config.js'
```
